# Synchronization Fix Summary

## Issue
Houses created on one device weren't appearing on other devices because of a field name mismatch between the TypeScript code (using camelCase) and Supabase database (using snake_case).

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Mapping Functions for House Objects
Added two mapper functions to convert between JavaScript/TypeScript camelCase and Supabase snake_case:
- `mapToHouse()`: Converts from database object to TypeScript object
- `mapToDbHouse()`: Converts from TypeScript object to database object

### 2. Updated House Service Methods
- Changed field references in queries from `userId` to `user_id`
- Changed field references in queries from `createdAt` to `created_at`
- Updated methods to use the mapping functions when:
  - Retrieving data: Using `data.map(mapToHouse)`
  - Inserting data: Using `mapToDbHouse(newHouse)`
  - Updating data: Using `mapToDbHouse(updatesWithTimestamp)`

### 3. Added Mapping Functions for Room Objects
Added similar mapping functions for rooms:
- `mapToRoom()`: Converts from database object to TypeScript object
- `mapToDbRoom()`: Converts from TypeScript object to database object

### 4. Updated Room Service Methods
- Changed field references from `houseId` to `house_id`
- Updated methods to use the mapping functions

### 5. Verified Environment Variables
- Confirmed that the environment variables in .env.example are using the correct naming convention (PUBLIC_ prefix)
- Ensured supabase.ts is using the correct variable names

## Testing Instructions

1. Make sure your `.env` file has the correct Supabase credentials:
   ```
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

2. Create a house in the application on one device

3. Log in on another device and verify the house appears

4. If still having issues:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify the Supabase tables exist and have the correct structure
   - Ensure the Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly configured
   - Confirm that authentication is working correctly on both devices

## Supabase Tables
Make sure these tables exist in your Supabase project:
- `houses`
- `rooms`
- `shopping_items`

Each should have the appropriate snake_case field names (`user_id`, `created_at`, etc.).
